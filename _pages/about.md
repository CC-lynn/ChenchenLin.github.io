Hi! I‘m a second-year Master student in the [School of Artificial Intelligence](https://sai.sysu.edu.cn/) at Sun Yat-sen University (SYSU), supervised by [Prof. Xuehe Wang](https://sai.sysu.edu.cn/teacher/234). Previously, I obtained my B.Eng. in Software Engineering 
from the Northwest A&F University (NWAFU) in 2023. 

My research interests include Distributed Optimization (e.g., Federated Learning), Game Theory, and Large Language Models (LLMs).
